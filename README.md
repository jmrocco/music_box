# Capacitive Touch Music Box
**Created by Juliette Rocco and Stephanie De Pol**

## What is it?
We created a touched activated spinning music box. A sensor was created with tinfoil and a jumper wire. Through this wire, capactiance was measured to sense a person's touch and activate the music box. The music box continues to play for however long the person is in contact with the sensor.
